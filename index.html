    <h1>Hello there! My name is Maria Reccoppa :)</h1>
    <h2> I am currently studying Computer Information Sytsems at Molloy College! 
    <h3> My hobbies include playing video games, coding, learning computer software, animation, and drawing! </h3>
    <h4> I am working towards getting my MOS certification in Excel this semester. I also would like to learn Python and get PCAP certified on my own time </h4>
    <h5> I love learning computer software and animation, so why not combine the both? :) I am also teaching myself software such as Maya and Blender. My goal is to be able to produce basic renders of objects.
      <h6> I started coding this website on 9.10.21. I am excited to see how far it will come! </h6>
